# Converting this blog to GitHub Discussions

This blog is part cop out and part a statement about minimalism; _I'm going to manage the content with `git` anyways, why not host it with `git` too?_

Up until now I've had issues enabled for discussing posts or asking me a question but since I created this blog GitHub have released the [Discusssions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) feature. This is a much better fit for a blog hosted within GitHub.

So, I've converted all issues to discussions. Real threads. What a time to be alive.

Ideally I would now disable issues so the tab is no longer accessible, but this causes a problem. Converted issues still exist in a closed state at their old URL, and turning off issues makes these links 404.

My solution here is to add a singular [PSA issue](https://github.com/tom-sherman/blog/issues/8) and use an [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser) to essentially forbit the creation of new issues, directing folks to create a discussion instead. Try it out yourself by trying to create an issue!

It is possible to still create an issue by fiddling with the URL tho. This would greatly annoy me and I ask nicely for you, dear reader, not to do that.
